# BreastCancerReccurence-

Breast cancer is a cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly-inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. In this report, we will study whether a person has a chance for reoccurrence of cancer cells by studying ones history of disease. We'll check the factors such as patient's age at the time of diagnosis(from age 20 to 79 as intervals of 9 years),menopausal status of the patient(classified as premenopause, lt40 and ge40 ), Tumour size(in mm),invasive nodes, node caps, degree of malignancy, Breast(either left or right),breast quadrant(the specific location of the affected breast ),irradiation(radiation therapy history of the patient).The dependent variable was Class(either Recurrence event or not).

The method that we will use is the artificial neural network / deep learning with the classification problem for predicting the Breast Cancer Recurrence . ANN are made of layers with an input and an output dimension. The latter is determined by the number of neurons (also called ‘nodes’), a computational unit that connects the weighted inputs through activation function (which helps the neuron to switch on/off). The weights, like in most of the machine learning algorithms, are randomly initialized and optimized during the training to minimize a loss function.
